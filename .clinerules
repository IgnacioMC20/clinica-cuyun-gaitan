# Clínica Médica Cuyún Gaitán - Project Intelligence

## Project Context
This is a medical clinic management system built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Fastify, and MongoDB. The project follows atomic design principles and is currently implementing authentication with Lucia Auth.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Authentication Flow (Current Priority)
- **Lucia Auth Integration**: Session-based authentication is preferred over JWT for security
- **Component Pattern**: Auth components follow atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **State Management**: Use React Context for auth state, TanStack Query for API calls
- **Route Protection**: Higher-order component pattern for protected routes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error display with medical-appropriate messaging

### Patient Management System (Completed)
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete patient lifecycle management implemented
- **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search with debouncing, advanced filtering by multiple criteria
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive form validation with TypeScript type safety
- **UI Components**: Atomic design with 7 atoms, 5 molecules, 4 organisms, 4 pages

## User Preferences & Workflow

### Development Approach
- **Memory-First**: Always read memory-bank files at session start for context
- **Atomic Design**: Strict adherence to atoms → molecules → organisms → pages hierarchy
- **TypeScript Safety**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Medical Theme**: Professional healthcare-appropriate design system
- **Testing**: Component testing with Vitest, API testing with Jest

### Code Organization Patterns
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks, kebab-case for utilities
- **Import Structure**: Barrel exports for clean imports, named imports for clarity
- **Component Props**: Props-driven design with variant systems for flexibility
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with fallback UI

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Medical UI/UX Standards
- **Color Palette**: Blue (trust), Green (success), Red (alerts), Orange (warnings), Gray (neutral)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, high contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with medical device breakpoints
- **Professional Tone**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces that reduce cognitive load

### Data Management Architecture
- **TanStack Query**: 5-minute stale time, 10-minute cache time, automatic invalidation
- **Query Key Factory**: Centralized cache management with organized key patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: Better UX for mutations with rollback on errors
- **Error Recovery**: User-friendly error messages with clear recovery paths

### Backend API Patterns
- **Fastify Framework**: High-performance with structured JSON logging
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent endpoint patterns with proper HTTP methods
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**: Document database with TypeScript-integrated ODM
- **Environment Config**: Flexible configuration for dev/staging/production

## Known Challenges & Solutions

### Authentication Implementation
- **Challenge**: TypeScript integration with Lucia Auth
- **Solution**: Proper type definitions and interface extensions
- **Challenge**: Session management across page refreshes
- **Solution**: Session persistence with MongoDB store

### Component Architecture
- **Challenge**: Maintaining atomic design principles at scale
- **Solution**: Strict component hierarchy and clear responsibility boundaries
- **Challenge**: Medical theme consistency across components
- **Solution**: Centralized theme system with Tailwind CSS custom properties

### Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Large patient datasets affecting UI performance
- **Solution**: Debounced search, pagination, and virtual scrolling (planned)
- **Challenge**: Bundle size optimization
- **Solution**: Code splitting and lazy loading implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Technology Stack Evolution
1. **Express → Fastify**: Migrated for better performance and TypeScript support
2. **Basic CSS → Tailwind**: Adopted utility-first approach with medical theme
3. **useState → TanStack Query**: Modern data fetching with caching
4. **Manual Auth → Lucia Auth**: Professional authentication system

### Architecture Refinements
1. **Component Structure**: Evolved from basic components to atomic design
2. **Type Safety**: Strengthened TypeScript configuration and shared types
3. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
4. **Testing Strategy**: Established testing patterns for components and APIs

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow
- **Memory Bank**: Always reference for project context and current status
- **Atomic Design**: Build components bottom-up (atoms first, then molecules, etc.)
- **TanStack Query**: Use for all server state management and API interactions
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking with proper interface definitions

### Quality Assurance
- **Component Testing**: Test atoms and molecules individually, organisms as integration
- **API Testing**: Comprehensive endpoint testing with various scenarios
- **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling and recovery paths
- **Accessibility**: Regular accessibility audits and keyboard navigation testing

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Planning
- **Multi-clinic Support**: Architecture supports future multi-tenancy
- **Role-based Access**: Foundation laid for complex permission systems
- **Integration Points**: API design allows for future third-party integrations
- **Performance**: Monitoring and optimization strategies planned

### Security Enhancements
- **Email Verification**: Planned for user registration
- **Two-factor Authentication**: Future security enhancement
- **Audit Logging**: Track user actions for compliance
- **Data Encryption**: Enhanced patient data protection

## Key Insights for Future Development

### What Works Well
- Atomic design provides excellent component reusability and maintainability
- TanStack Query significantly improves data management and user experience
- Medical theme creates professional, trustworthy interface
- TypeScript prevents many runtime errors and improves developer experience

### Areas for Improvement
- Authentication system needs completion for production readiness
- Testing coverage should be expanded for better reliability
- Performance optimization needed for larger datasets
- Documentation could be enhanced for easier onboarding

### Critical Success Factors
- Maintain medical-first design approach for user trust
- Keep authentication simple but secure for healthcare compliance
- Ensure accessibility for diverse user needs in medical environments
- Focus on reliability and error recovery for critical patient data
