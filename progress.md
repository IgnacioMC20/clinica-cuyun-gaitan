## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions:
- Using atomic design methodology
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind for styling consistency
- TanStack Query for data management
- React Testing Library + Vitest for testing

### File Structure:
```
ui/src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/          # Basic building blocks
â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/      # Simple combinations
â”œâ”€â”€ organisms/      # Complex sections
â””â”€â”€ pages/          # Full page layouts
```

### Final Implementation:
1. âœ… Complete atomic design system implementation
2. âœ… TanStack Query integration with QueryClientProvider
3. âœ… Theme provider integration for dark/light mode support
4. âœ… Medical-appropriate styling and design system
5. âœ… Clean project structure with only planned components
6. âœ… TypeScript compilation with no errors
7. âœ… Production-ready medical clinic application
